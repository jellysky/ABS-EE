Comments,,,"The asset-level data file contains detailed information for each automobile loan contract about its identification, origination, contract terms, financed vehicle, obligor, contract activity, servicing and status. The information presented in this prospectus about the pool of automobile loan contracts is based on calculations made as of the cutoff date. The asset-level data presented in the initial asset-level data filing may have been calculated as of a different date. Further, certain characteristics of the auto loans are required to be calculated differently in the asset-level data filing than how they are calculated in this prospectus. As a result, certain asset-level data presented in this prospectus, including, but not limited to, such data related to principal balances, APRs, original terms, remaining terms, weighted averages, FICO¬ Auto Scores and geographic locations of obligors may not match the data presented in the initial asset- level data filing due to those differences in how this data is calculated.",,,May be from start of period,,"Certain asset-level data, such as data related to collections, repurchased receivables, losses on the receivables and repossessions, may not match the aggregate data provided on the investor report due to differences in how this data is required to be calculated for asset-level data and how this data is calculated for the investor report.",,,,ABS-EE as of closing date (Feb16) so may not match Jan 1st balance exactly,,,,,,,,,,,
